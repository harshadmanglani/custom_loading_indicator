# custom_loading_indicator

A Flutter package to customise the loading indicators with your organisation's logo.

Let's say you're a dentist and your app has the standard circular loading indicator. If you want to try
something new, this is what your customised circular loading indicator would like!

Make sure you provide an imagePath for an image that has been registered as an asset in your pubsec.yaml file.
